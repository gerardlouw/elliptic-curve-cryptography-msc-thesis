\begin{thm}{}{}
Let $E / \Fq$ be an elliptic curve, then
\[
\#E(\Fq) = q + 1 - \tr \phi_q.
\]
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
From \cref{dfn:trace} we have \[\tr\phi_q \defeq 1 + \deg \phi_q - \deg([1] - \phi_q) = 1 + q - \#E(\Fq),\] since $\deg([1] - \phi_q) = \#E(\Fq)$ by \cref{thm:one_min_frob_prop}.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}{Hasse}{hasse}
Let $E / \Fq$ be an elliptic curve, then
\[
\left|\tr \phi_q\right| \leq 2\sqrt{q}.
\]
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
Let $t \defeq \tr \phi_q$ and recall $\deg \phi_q = q$ from \cref{thm:frob_prop}. Then
\begin{align*}
([t] \hat{\phi}_q - [2q]) ([t] \phi_q - [2q]) &= [t]^2 \hat{\phi}_q \phi_q - [t] [2q] (\hat{\phi}_q + \phi_q) + [2q]^2 \\
&= [t]^2[q] - [t]^2[2q] + [2q]^2,
\end{align*}
so that $\deg([t] \phi_q - [2q]) = 4q^2 - t^2q = q(4q - t^2)$. Since degrees are non-negative, this means $4 q - t^2 \geq 0$, or equivalently $\left|t\right| \leq \sqrt{2q}$.
\end{proof}

As an immediate consequence of Hasse's theorem, we have the asymptotic relationship $\#E(\Fq) \sim q$. This will be useful when studying the time complexity of certain algorithms for elliptic curves.

It can be shown that the bound given by Hasse's theorem is tight. In fact, for each $t \in \Z$ such that $|t| \leq 2\sqrt{q}$, there exists an elliptic curve $E / \Fq$ with $\#E(\Fq) = q + 1 - t$.
