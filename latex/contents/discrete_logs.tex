%TODO Samaev: EVALUATION OF DISCRETE LOGARITHMS IN A GROUP OF p-TORSION POINTS OF AN ELLIPTIC CURVE IN CHARACTERISTIC p
%TODO Ruck: ON THE DISCRETE LOGARITHM IN THE DIVISOR CLASS GROUP OF CURVES

In this chapter, we introduce the notion of \emph{discrete logarithms} on a cyclic subgroup of a group variety. We then discuss various approaches for computing discrete logarithms, in general as well as for certain special classes of elliptic curves. As we will see in \cref{chp:ecc}, elliptic curve cryptography is based on the assumption that it is difficult to compute these discrete logarithms for elliptic curves over finite fields. The books \citep{Galbraith,Washington} are extensively used as references throughout this chapter.
