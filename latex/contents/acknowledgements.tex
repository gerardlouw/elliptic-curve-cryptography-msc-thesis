I would like to thank my wife, Andrea, and my parents, Nelmarie and Jacques, for their interest in my research, as well as their support, which was unwavering during the most challenging times of my studies. I also wish to thank my supervisor, Florian, for his suggestion of such a fascinating research topic, and for his invaluable advice and guidance, which kept me focused on my goals.

I acknowledge the financial contributions of the National Research Foundation, the Harry Crossley Foundation and the MIH Media Lab to my research. I also thank the MIH Media Lab for providing me with a stimulating environment in which much of my research was conducted.
