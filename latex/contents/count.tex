%To make use of a group variety $V$ in cryptographic applications, it will be essential to know the number of $\Fq$-rational points $\#V(\Fq)$ on the variety. For multiplicative groups of finite fields, we trivially have $\#\un{\Fq} = q - 1$. For elliptic curves, we have established Hasse's bound. However, the range of possibilities is too broad to allow a brute-force search. In this chapter, we will focus on the case of counting the number of points $\#\E(\Fq)$ on an elliptic curve $E$.
